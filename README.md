# Map-Algorithm
This code emphasizes building the MapPlanner class. Making the MapPlanner class. This study applies modifications to Dijkstra's algorithm 

This project showcases the implementation of a robust MapPlanner class designed for urban route planning with unique constraints, such as avoiding left turns. The program applies graph theory concepts and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize routing decisions. Key features include the ability to identify the farthest street from a depot, support for bidirectional street navigation, and efficient route calculation under strict turning constraints. The implementation highlights scalability, rigorous testing, and the use of advanced data structures to handle complex municipal layouts effectively.
